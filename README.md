# Introduction

## The Project

Individuals interested in tracking and improving their ear health will be our users and Professionals who can use the data to better understand patient ear health trends.
This is why we created **EarXScore**.

[**EarXScore**](https://earxscore.best/) aims to provide a quantifiable score reflecting the condition of a user's ears, referred to as the EarHealthScore. This score will help users understand their ear health better and take necessary actions for improvement.

Other features include: editing the User's profile, modifying the user settings, and recommendation according to users test result.

## The Context

This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year at ALX Software Engineering. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.
